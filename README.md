<summary>2. AWS ElasticBeanstalk: Custom Domain + HTTPS setting</summary>

#### Background
After done with AWS EB basic setup, url will look like `http://land-liveplus-env-prod.ap-northeast-2.elasticbeanstalk.com/`.
This is the url with no TLS enabled that AWS just assigned.

We Need to apply custom domain + TLS enabled like `https://api.landcorp.io`, `https:/dev-api.landcorp.io`

#### Solution

* (Prerequisite) EB + PostgreSql (not decoupled) Setup Complete
* Custom Domain `record routing setup`
  * https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/routing-to-beanstalk-environment.html#routing-to-beanstalk-environment-create-resource-record-set
  * Since we can use `Region` (if using the latest EB) alias can be mapped
  * Create `hosted zone` at `Route53`
    * dev-api.landcorp.io --> A type
    * ElasticBeanstalk's existing URL as `value`
  * (if already done, skip) Change Name Servers in Google Domains to that of Route53
    * https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43402925/how-to-use-google-domain-on-elastic-beanstalk
  * Check `dev-api.landcorp.io`
    * Need to wait for about 30mins
* HTTPS Setup
Please refer https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/configuring-https-elb.html
  * Register wildcard certificate for at `certificate manager` (*.landcorp.io)
    * https://ap-northeast-2.console.aws.amazon.com/acm/home?region=ap-northeast-2#/firstrun/
    * both `landcorp.io`, `*.landcorp.io` need to be created
    * CNAME will be popped up. Just register to Route53 by clicking button.
  * In EB GUI, setup https listener in Application Load Balancer section
    * Please refer to the docs above
  * http â†’ https redirect setup
    * https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/elb-redirect-http-to-https-using-alb/
    * Don't change at EB console. Please go to EC2 console, load balancer panel and change `Default Action`
* Success!

<summary>3. AWS ElasticBeanstalk: RDS for Production setup</summary>

<p>

#### Background
* EB+RDS automatic setup is not suitable for `production` mode.
* It isn't ideal for a production environment because it ties the lifecycle of the database instance to the lifecycle of your application's environment.

* You need to decouple RDS
This enables you to connect multiple environments to a database, terminate an environment without affecting the database, and perform seamless updates with blue-green deployments.


#### Solution
* Please refer to AWS docs
-> https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/rds-external-defaultvpc.html

* Create PostgreSql database
  * You will need to create only `default security group` but this will be changed soon
* Create new `Security Group`
  * Go to the newly created database, click `VPC security groups` in  `Security` tab
  * Below is the Inbound rules for automatically created of EB <> RDS. Refer this to make modification

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/Land-Corporation/land-live-api/blob/master/photo/inbound_rules.png" width="80%" title="hover text">
</p>

  * Please be cautious when setting up `Source`, numerous `Security groups` are located in one EB/EC2. Please refer to the existing Security groups of EC2 and their connection rule in `land-liveplus-env-dev` to configure.
    * In on sentence, just connect security group ID of EC2.
  * For `Type setting` ->  PostgreSql should be setup, not All TCP
  * Remove default in `RDS security group` and add new
* RDS security group â†’ EB environment
  * Refer to the doc. Please be catious that this is to add existing RDS to security group
* Append RDS related environment variables
  * Please refer to the doc. Do it at `EB configuration`
* Done!
